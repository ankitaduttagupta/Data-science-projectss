### *Following is a list of some the of the projects which I completed in my journey of  learning Data Science* .... 


## *[Mahindra First Choice Services](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Mahindra_first_choice_capstone)*

It is a capstone project from Grey Atom, whose goal is to :

    1. Generate meaningful insights on Geolocation Based customer & revenue Analysis
    
    2. Divide the customer based into segments based on their cartype, servicetype & total expenditure so that customers respond similarly to different marketing campaigns.
    
    3. LifeTime Value analysis of customers to maintain relationship with high profit generating customers in future & finding potential customers from the population

## *[Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Prediction)*

Did some analysis of tweet data and sentiment prediction

## *[Anomaly Detection ](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Time-Series-Analysis)*

Purpose of this project  was  to detect outliers from electronic data  and perform time series analysis .

## *[Financial Delinquency Prediction](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Financial-Delinquency-Prediction)*

 Created a model that estimates probability of a customer defaulting based on certain features, categorizing them as a high risk or low risk borrower to determine whether to loan money and how much.
 

## *[Haptik-Chatbot-analysis-using-NLP](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Haptik-Chatbot-analysis-part1)*

It is a dataset of Haptik containing the messages it receives from the customers and which topic(class) the messages refer to, performed analysis and  label classification

## MORE--->

## *[Haptik-chatbot-analysis-part-2](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Haptik-chatbot-analysis-part-2)*

Built a multi-label classifier using this training data. The classifier would tag all the possible domains for each query. 


## *[Indian Startup data analysis ](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Haptik-chatbot-analysis-part-2)*
 Found some Insights on the Startup company trend of India

## *[Medical Insurance Data ](https://github.com/ankitaduttagupta/Medical_insurance_EDA_prediction)*
